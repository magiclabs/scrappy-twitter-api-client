# Scrappy Twitter API
Scrappy Twitter API is a Go-backend project that is secured by the Magic SDK for Go. 

# Scrappy Twitter API (CLIENT)
This Next.js app authenticates the user and generates the [Decentralised ID Token (DIDT)](https://docs.magic.link/decentralized-id) required to make POST or DELETE requests with the [Scrappy Twitter API](https://github.com/seemcat/scrappy-twitter-api-server).

# Noteworthy Package Dependencies:
- [Magic SDK](https://docs.magic.link/client-sdk/web/get-started): Allows users to sign up or log in.
- [SWR](https://github.com/vercel/swr): Lets us get user info using a hook.
- [@hapi/iron](https://hapi.dev/module/iron/): Lets us encrypt the login cookie for more security.

# Quickstart
## Magic Setup
1. Sign up for an account on [Magic](https://magic.link/).
2. Create an app.
3. Copy your app's Test Secret Key (you'll need it soon).

## Client Setup
1. `git clone https://github.com/seemcat/scrappy-twitter-api-client.git`
2. `cd scrappy-twitter-api-client`
3. `mv .env.local.example .env.local`
4. Populate .env.local with the correct Test keys from your Magic app:
    ```
    NEXT_PUBLIC_MAGIC_TEST_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_XXXXX
    NEXT_PUBLIC_MAGIC_TEST_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_XXXXX
    NEXT_PUBLIC_HAPI_IRON_SECRET=this-is-a-secret-value-with-at-least-32-characters
    ```

    **Note**: The `HAPI_IRON_SECRET` is needed by @hapi/iron to encrypt an object. Feel free to leave the default value as is in dev.
5. yarn
6. yarn dev
7. Generate your DID token and keep this open (you'll need it soon).

## Test with Postman
1. Follow the steps listed [here](https://github.com/seemcat/scrappy-twitter-api-server) to spin up your own local Go server and to set up the Scrappy Twitter API Postman Collection.
2. You'll be passing the DID token you just generated as a Bearer token into the Postman Collectionâ€™s HTTP Authorization request header.
3. Send your requests to the **DEV** Scrappy Twitter API! ðŸŽ‰
